# OpenGL Ray-tracing
This is an experimental Computer Graphics project that uses OpenGL for GPU-accelerated ray-tracing.

**Features include:**
- Ray-traced soft shadows
- Ray-traced global illumination
- Progressive rendering
- Ray-traced reflections (including blurry reflections based on surface roughness)
- HDR Skyboxes
- Animation rendering

The project and its development process were showcased in [this video](https://youtu.be/A61S_2swwAc) on my YouTube channel.
